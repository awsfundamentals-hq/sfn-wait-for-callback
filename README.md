# sfn-wait-for-callback

Welcome to the `sfn-wait-for-callback` repository! This project complements our [blog post](https://blog.awsfundamentals.com/building-a-real-world-use-case-with-step-functions-and-the-callback-pattern), demonstrating a real-world application of AWS Step Functions using the callback pattern.

We implement a basic UI that starts a Step Function, let's it wait for a specific input (title forbidden), and continues it only on user input.

## Deploy

You can use any package manager, we've used pnpm. Follow these commands to deploy the project to your AWS default profile:

```
pnpm install
pnpm run deploy:prod
```


## Running Locally

To run the project on your local machine:

1. Install dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```


2. Start the development server:

```
pnpm run dev
```


3. For the frontend, navigate to the `packages/frontend` directory and start its development server:

```
cd packages/frontend
pnpm run dev
```


## Components

### Frontend

**Technology**: Next.js

**Submit Articles**: We've implemented a mock form that submits new articles. We only send new article titles. If you send the title `forbidden` a step Function will halt.

**Admin Page**: In `/admin` we've built an admin page that shows you all waiting step functions.
On `approve` or `reject` you will continue the Step Function with the respective decision.

### Backend Resources

- **Step Function**: Built using AWS CDK, employing the chain syntax for state management.

- **Lambda Functions**:
  - REST API: Starts Step Functions and retrieves items from DynamoDB.
  - Approval Receiver: Handles decision and task token reception.
  - Manual Approval Request: Records Step Functions awaiting approval in DynamoDB.

- **DynamoDB**: Stores active Step Functions and related metadata.

## Costs

This project is serverless, meaning it is 100% usage-based. Testing should be free under the AWS Free Tier. For larger-scale operations, be mindful of DynamoDB scan costs and Step Function state changes.
